## Conventions

- Use PascalCase for naming components and camelCase for variables and functions
- Create a folder for each component and use index.tsx for the file itself
- Use arrow functions for creating components
- Do not use inline typing

## Contribution

- Use [conventional commits](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/git-basics-conventional-commits/) for your changes.
- Create branches for each change in the following format <category/description-in-kebab-case> e.g.
 
  ```bash
  git branch feature/button-component
  git branch fix/background-img-not-in-position
  git branch refactor/extract-component
  git branch style/color-picker
  ```
